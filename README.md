# Automatic-Garden-Watering
## Inspiration
Garden management takes in a lot of effort when it comes to watering the plants and checking the plants. Therefore we want to make it easier for people who can't be in the garden often and for people who can't really contribute to caring for and managing the garden because of several reasons like being too far from it.

## What it does
This system consists of two parts, security, and watering. For security, the buzzer will beep with the red LED turned on to alert people when the smoke detector detects fire in the garden. Also, the sprinkler on the ceiling will start functioning to extinguish the fire following the buzzer. For watering, when the moisture sensor detects a certain low level of moisture in the soil, the moisture sensor will notify the system and automatic watering will be initiated as the sprinkler will start watering the plants. Moreover, the green LED will turn on, indicating that the soil is moisturized, or the green LED will turn off which indicates that the soil is not moisturized.
